# Collaborative Filtering Assignment

This repository showcases the implementation of Collaborative Filtering using Deep Neural Networks for an assignment.

## Files Included

- `main.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook that demonstrates the implementation of MLP and Autoencoder models.
- Details on the dataset, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Instructions for Running

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Upload the dataset files (e.g., `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv`) to the same folder.
3. Execute all cells to train and evaluate the models.

## Evaluation Results

- Both models were trained for 10 epochs.
- Performance was evaluated using the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) metric.
